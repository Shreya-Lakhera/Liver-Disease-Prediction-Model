In the provided code, various machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods are applied to the Indian Liver Patient dataset to predict the presence or absence of liver disease. 
The best model is determined based on its performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on the validation dataset. In this specific case, the Extra Trees Classifier and/or SVM is chosen as the best model based on the provided code. The choice of the best model depends on the specific problem, dataset, and evaluation metrics considered important for the given task.

The dataset used is provided by Patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India and is picked up from kaggle.
